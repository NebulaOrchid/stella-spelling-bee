# Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effect files for the app.

## Required Sound Files

For the MVP, we need the following sound effects:

- `correct.mp3` - Played when user spells word correctly
- `incorrect.mp3` - Played when user spells word incorrectly
- `celebration.mp3` - Played on achievements/milestones
- `click.mp3` - UI interaction sound
- `whoosh.mp3` - Transition sound

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:
1. Use placeholder sounds from free resources like:
   - [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
   - [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
   - [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)

2. Or generate simple beeps using Web Audio API (handled in code)

## Future Sound Packs

The sound system is designed to support multiple sound packs:
- Default pack (kid-friendly beeps and chimes)
- Fun pack (cartoon sounds)
- Nature pack (natural sounds)
- Custom packs (user uploads)
